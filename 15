Basically there are two kinds of line.
     01.Vertical
     02.Horizontal
we can represent the diagram with binary value."1" for horizontal and "0"for vertical.A starting point has to follow (m X n) binary value
to go to the end point where m is the number of rows and n is the number of column.
For example in a 2X2 grid we have to go through 2 vertical line(binary value 0),and two horizontal line(binary value 1).
The number of routes will be the number of permutation of binary 0,and 1.
in 2X2 grid the number of total routes is=(2*2)!/(2!)*(2!) 
                                         =(4!)/(2!)^2 
                                         =(4!)/4 
                                         =3! 
                                         =6(Ans).
we have to find the result for 20 X 20 grid.
in 20 X 20 grid the number of total routes is=(2*20)!/(20!)*(20!)
                                             =(40!)/(20!)^2
                                             =137846528820(Ans).
The code for this problem is very easy.So I dont show the code here.
